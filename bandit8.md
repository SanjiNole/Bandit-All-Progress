Connect: SSH into bandit8@your_ip_address -p 2220 using the password from Level 7.
The Hint: The level description usually mentions something about a password being accessible only on the localhost or 127.0.0.1. This means the password isn't in a regular file you can just cat.
Understanding localhost: localhost (or the IP address 127.0.0.1) refers to the computer you are currently logged into. Services running on localhost are only accessible from that machine itself.
Finding the Service: You need to figure out what service is running on localhost and how to interact with it to get the password. The level description might give a hint about the port number this service is using. Common web ports are 80 or 443, but it could be something else.
Checking Open Ports: You can use the netstat or ss command to see what network ports are listening on your machine. Try this:
Bash

netstat -tuln
or
Bash

ss -tuln
Look for a service that is listening on the address 127.0.0.1 and a specific port number (other than the SSH port 2220). The -t option shows TCP connections, -u shows UDP, -l shows listening sockets, and -n shows numerical addresses and ports.
Interacting with the Service: Once you find a service listening on localhost (e.g., on port 30000), you need a way to communicate with it. Since the prompt often doesn't specify a protocol, a simple approach is to try using netcat (nc) to connect to it:
Bash

nc 127.0.0.1 [port_number]
Replace [port_number] with the actual port number you found.
Sending a Request (If Needed): Sometimes, the service might expect a specific request before it gives you the password. Common simple requests are often just pressing Enter or typing a basic HTTP request like GET / HTTP/1.0 followed by two Enter presses. Experiment if just connecting doesn't immediately give you the password.
Getting the Password: If you connect successfully and send the right request (if needed), the service running on localhost should send back the password for Bandit Level 9.
Connect to Level 9: Disconnect with exit and SSH into bandit9@your_ip_address -p 2220 using the password you found.

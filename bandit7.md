Connect: Use SSH with username bandit7 and the password you just obtained from Level 6 to connect to the server.
The Clue: The level description usually mentions something about a file being owned by a different user (often bandit7) and being located somewhere unusual, possibly related to cron jobs.
Explore Cron Jobs: Cron is a system for scheduling tasks. There's a directory where user-specific cron jobs are often stored. Try looking here:
Bash

ls /etc/cron.d/
Examine Files: You'll likely see one or more files in /etc/cron.d/. Use ls -l to check the permissions and ownership of these files. Look for a file that might be owned by bandit7 or another unusual user.
Read the Relevant File: Once you identify a promising file (often named after the user who owns it, like cronjob_bandit7 or similar), use cat to view its contents:
Bash

cat /etc/cron.d/[suspicious_filename]
Spot the Command: Inside the cron job file, you'll probably see a line that specifies a command to be run at a certain time. This command might involve reading or echoing the password to a specific location. Look for a command that uses cat or echo and outputs something that looks like a password.
Execute the Command (If Necessary): Sometimes, the cron job might output the password to a file in a temporary location (like /tmp). If you see a command doing this, you might need to wait a short while for the cron job to run (they often run every minute) and then check that temporary file using cat /tmp/[filename].
Get the Password: The output of cat on the cron job file or the temporary file should reveal the password for Bandit Level 8.
Connect to Level 8: Disconnect with exit and SSH into bandit8@your_ip_address -p 2220 using the password you found.

My Goal: I need to find the password for the next level, which is likely hidden somewhere on a web page.

The Clue: The level description mentions "something can be found at a specific port." This strongly suggests a web server running on a non-standard port.

Finding the Port: I'm already logged into the Bandit server via SSH. The netstat -antp command is my friend here. It shows all active network connections, listening ports, and the programs associated with them. I'll run this command:

Bash

netstat -antp
I'll look for a line that shows a program listening on a port other than the standard HTTP port 80 (or HTTPS port 443). I'll likely see something like tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:<some_port> 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN <some_process>. I'll note down that <some_port> number.

Accessing the Web Server: Now that I have the port number, I can use a command-line web client like curl to access the web page. I'll replace <some_port> with the actual port number I found:

Bash

curl http://localhost:<some_port>
Since the web server is likely only accessible from the server itself, I'll use localhost (or 127.0.0.1).

Finding the Password: The output of the curl command will probably be the password for Bandit Level 12. It might be directly on the page or within some HTML content.

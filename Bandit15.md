Steps to Solve:

Explore your current directory: Once you're logged in as bandit14, start by listing the files in your home directory:

You should see a file named .bandit15rc. The leading . makes it a hidden file, which is why the -a flag is important to see it.

Examine the contents of .bandit15rc: Let's see what's inside this file. Use the cat command:

You'll likely see a line that looks something like this:

This looks like a variable assignment in a shell configuration file. The <some_command> part is what's interesting. It's probably a command that, when executed, will reveal the password for the next level.

Execute the command: To get the password, you need to run the command that's assigned to the mysecret variable. You can do this using command substitution. There are a couple of ways to do this:

Using backticks (``):

Let's break this down:

cat .bandit15rc: Prints the content of the file.
cut -d'=' -f2: Splits the line at the = character and takes the second field (the command).
tr -d ' ': Removes any spaces from the command. This is important because sometimes there might be extra spaces that would prevent the command from running correctly.
The backticks `` execute the resulting command.
Using $(): This is the more modern and often preferred way for command substitution:

Either of these commands will execute the hidden command and print the password for Bandit Level 16 to your terminal.

Log in to Bandit Level 16: Once you have the password, you can log in to the next level using SSH:

Enter the password you just found when prompted.

Explanation of the Security Concept:

This level highlights the importance of file permissions and hidden files. While you couldn't directly read the password file under the bandit15 directory due to permission restrictions, the developers left a clue in a hidden configuration file in your home directory. This is a common scenario where developers or administrators might store temporary or configuration-related secrets. However, if not properly secured, these hidden files can be exploited.
